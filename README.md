# Mazing

I'm enjoying the book [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) by Jamis Buck and decided to port the first chapter to Swift. However, the Binary Tree creation code has been ported, but not Sidewinder.

The Cell and Grid classes are roughly the same. The PNG creation method has been extracted to a UIView that draws in a CGContext.

**Requires Xcode 7**
